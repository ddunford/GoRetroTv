# Test Plan: Phase 5 — Browser and deployment

## Test Cases
- [ ] **TC-5.1: Frames reach the browser** (covers: TASK-5.1, TASK-5.7) — the canvas matches the core's
  framebuffer hash.
- [ ] **TC-5.2: The status line tracks real machine state** (covers: TASK-5.2, TASK-5.7) — it must be driven by
  observed state, not a timer. The predecessor's said Ready twenty seconds early because it keyed on
  a task count that plateaus before the work starts.
- [ ] **TC-5.3: A key press from the page reaches the firmware** (covers: TASK-5.3, TASK-5.7).
- [ ] **TC-5.4: Press sky, get the menu** (covers: TASK-5.4, TASK-5.7) — end to end through the deployed path.
- [ ] **TC-5.5: The demo host serves the page over TLS** (covers: TASK-5.5, TASK-5.7) — **checked against
  `goretrotv.demosrv.uk`, not localhost**, and every asset it fetches is verified to return its own
  content rather than the SPA fallback.
- [ ] **TC-5.6: Developer surfaces are unreachable publicly** (covers: TASK-5.6, TASK-5.7) — the gdb port and
  instrument endpoints refuse from outside. Asserted against the deployed host.
- [ ] **TC-5.7: The TS decoder is pinned to the Go encoder's actual bytes** (covers: TASK-5.7, TASK-5.9) — feed the decoder a fixture **captured from the running server** and assert the
  projection. A hand-authored fixture passes while the wire differs, which is the failure mode where
  the contract test exists, is green, and still ships the bug.
- [ ] **TC-5.8: The page survives losing the box** (covers: TASK-5.10, TASK-5.7) — kill the socket
  mid-session: the page says so, reconnects, and resumes. Halt the machine: a readable reason, not a
  frozen canvas. Press a key while disconnected: refused visibly, never swallowed.
- [ ] **TC-5.9: The handset acknowledges input and is operable by keyboard** (covers: TASK-5.2, TASK-5.7) — every button shows a pressed state, is reachable by **a real `Tab` press** (programmatic
  focus matches `:focus` but not reliably `:focus-visible`, so it measures the browser's heuristic
  rather than the stylesheet), shows a visible focus ring asserted **by colour** rather than by the
  presence of an outline, and is operable by touch at a usable target size.
